For our COSC 304 group project (Introduction to Databases, Fall 2022) at the University of British-Columbia, we created a vinyl record store named "Based Records". The website is a simple e-commerce site that allows users to browse through a catalog of vinyl records, add them to a shopping cart, and checkout. The website also allows users to create an account and login to view their order history. The website is built using Java servlets and JSPs, and the database is built using SQL.

Our group received one of the top 5 highest marks in the class for this project, thereby gaining a [certification for our dedication](https://ca.badgr.com/public/assertions/moYWFdjHR6aVgz287Tgfpw).
